# Sorting Visualizer using Python and Tkinter

## üí° Project Idea
This project visualizes how different sorting algorithms work.
It displays an array of random numbers as vertical bars, and as sorting occurs, 
the bars move and change color to show comparisons and swaps in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Implemented
1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting items into their correct position.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

3. **Quick Sort**
   - Divides the list using a pivot element and recursively sorts subarrays.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) average
   - **Space Complexity:** O(log n)
